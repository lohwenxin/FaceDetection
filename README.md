## Developer's Thoughts
This is my first project which dabbles into using Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is such a hot topic now that I have wanted to try a project on it for the longest time. I want to build my own AI models next, perhaps in a future project! 

I followed the tutorial in this link to guide me, but I added the implementation of age and gender prediction which was not covered in the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVClHLwv-4I&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified
